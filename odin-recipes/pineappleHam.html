        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>12 pound bone-in ham</li>
            <li>half a cup whole cloves</li>
            <li>20 ounce can of pineapple rings</li>
            <li>half a cup of packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>12 fluid ounces can/bottle lemon-lime flavoured carbonated beverage</li>
            <li>4 ounce jar of chopper maraschino cherries</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place ham in a roasting pan. Score the rind of the ham with a diamond pattern. Press a clove into the center of each diamond. Drain the juice from the pineapple rings into a medium bowl, and stir in the brown sugar and lemon-lime soda. Coat the ham with this mixture. Arrange the pineapple rings over the outside of the ham. Place a maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple ring, and secure with a toothpick.</li>
            <li>Bake uncovered for 4 to 5 hours, basting frequently with the juices, until the internal temperature of the ham is 160 degrees F (72 degrees C). Be sure the meat thermometer is not touching the bone. Remove toothpicks before serving.</li>
        </ol>
